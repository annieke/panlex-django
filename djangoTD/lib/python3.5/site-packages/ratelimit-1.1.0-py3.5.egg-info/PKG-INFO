        APIs are a very common way to interact with web services. As the need to consume data grows, so does the number of API calls necessary to remain up to date with data sources. However many API providers constrain developers from making too many API calls. This is know as rate limiting and in a worst case scenario your application can be banned from making further API calls if it abuses these limits.
        
        This packages introduces a method decorator preventing a method from being called more than once within a given time period. This should prevent API providers from banning your applications by conforming to set rate limits.

        Usage
        -----
        
        To use this package you simply have to declare the decorator before the method you wish to rate limit:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from ratelimit import *
            import requests
        
            @rate_limited(1)
            def call_api(self, url):
              response = requests.get(url)
        
              if response.status_code != 200:
                raise ApiError('Cannot call API: {}'.format(response.status_code))
        
              return response
        
        This method makes a call to our API. Note that this method has been implemented with a decorator that dictates that this method may only be called once per second.
        
        The argument passed into the decorator imposes the time that must elapse before a method can be called again.
